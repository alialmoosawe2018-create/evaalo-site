/**
 * The job title a row should DISPLAY: the role its campaign is hiring for.
 *
 * `position_applied_for` on a person or an application holds what the applicant
 * typed or picked about themselves, which is routinely a different job from the
 * one they applied to — measured on production, 4 of 6 recent applications
 * disagreed with their campaign, one of them "Mud Engineer" against a campaign
 * for "Senior HR Specialist".
 *
 * Every screen therefore had to repair the value itself, and each did it
 * separately or not at all:
 *   - the notifications card fetched the campaigns in a SECOND request and
 *     patched the rows after the first paint, so the wrong title was visible for
 *     about a second on every refresh;
 *   - the campaign cards fell back to the most common applicant-typed title
 *     until that same request landed;
 *   - the shared voice/video interview pages never repaired it at all, so the
 *     CANDIDATE opened the link and saw a job that was not the one being filled.
 *
 * Resolving it once on the read path removes the second phase rather than hiding
 * it, and it fixes records already in the database — no migration, no backfill.
 * The applicant's own wording is preserved on the row as `declaredPosition`.
 *
 * This is display only. What the interview agent is told to ask about still
 * comes from applicationJobContext.ts.
